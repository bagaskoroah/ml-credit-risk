# Credit Risk Classification Model with Threshold Tuning

## Project Overview

This project documents by experimenting **Threshold Tuning** on the **Credit Risk** dataset, obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/laotse/credit-risk-dataset/data.

The goal of the project is to understand how threshold tuning affects to the performance of classification model, determined by the recall score, precision score, f1-score, and ROC-AUC score. 

## Methods Used

The experiment focuses on several boosting algorithms: 
- **RandomForestClassifier**
- **XGBoost**
- **CatBoost**

I also use non-boosting model for this project: K-Nearest Neighbors.

Each model is trained and compared based on common classification
metrics.

## Key Steps

1.  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis
3.  Training Boosting Models
4.  Model Comparison
5.  Model Threshold Tuning & Save Tuned-Threshold Model
6.  Extracting Feature Importance & Interpretation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Results Summary

The chosen best model in this project is CatBoost.
